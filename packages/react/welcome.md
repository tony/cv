# I am Tony Narlock

## Open source programmer

Created software projects and contributed to over 100.

They are visible via these cards.

## Hard worker, but can prioritize value

To give proportional emphasis to jobs and avoid being buried
in typo fixes, small contributions are filtered by default.

## Onboarder: From startups to large companies

On at least two cases, startups I've worked for were acquired. These are
represented by a special card.

## Movement: Eyeing principal and lead developer roles

To impress, examples of large contributions are given emphasis and prominence.
